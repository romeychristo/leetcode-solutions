Please note: Downloading and running these files directly may not work as expected.

This is because identical variable names are used across different files and folders, which can cause conflicts in TypeScript projects.

For best results, we recommend copying the relevant code snippets into your own project, where you can adjust variable names and configurations as needed.

Instructions to create your own TypeScript project in vscode:

1. Install Node JS - https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. To install Typescript In code editor terminal run - npm install typescript
3. After TS installs, run this in terminal - npx tsc --init
4. Create index.ts file or rename to anything. Example: anything.ts
5. To compile, in terminal run - tsc index.ts
6. The above line will compile and create an index.js file
7. Create an index.html file and link the index.js file as script.
8. Check any of the folders in the repository to understand how I have linked the file and how the file structure works.
